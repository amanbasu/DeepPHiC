# DeepPHiC: Predicting promoter-centered chromatin interactions using a deep learning approach

We developed a supervised multi-modal deep learning model, which utilizes a comprehensive set of features including genomic sequence, epigenetic signals and anchor distance to predict tissue/cell type-specific genome-wide promoter-enhancer and promoter-promoter interactions. We further extend the deep learning model in a multi-task learning and transfer learning framework. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning approaches and robust to the inclusion of anchor distance. In addition, we find that the proposed approach can achieve comparable prediction performance using biologically relevant tissues/cell types compared to using all tissues/cell types especially for predicting promoter-enhancer interactions.
